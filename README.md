# core-v-mcu-cli-test
Command-Line-Interface test routines for the CORE-V MCU.

Core-v-mcu-cli-test is a stand-alone program that runs on the CORE-V MCU under FreeRTOS and is controlled from a terminal.
At the time of this writing (2022-03-09) "cli-test" runs in simulation under Verilator or in FPGA emulation on a Digilent Nexys A7-100T evaluation kit.
Setup instructions for the Nexys A7 and a terminal emulator to run cli-test can be found in the [CORE-V-MCU Quick Start Guide](https://github.com/MikeOpenHWGroup/core-v-mcu/blob/qsg/emulation/quickstart/README.md).
A bitstream compatible with the Nexys A7-100T that supports cli-test, and instructions for loading the bitstream onto the Nexys can also be found with the Quick Start Guide.

The Quick Start Guide will get you up and running with cli-test, which is a reasonable testing platform, but not a convenient development platform.
It is expected that the majority of cli-test users will want to run it from an Integrated Development Environment.
The remainder of this document will get you set up with the **Eclipse-IDE**.

## Eclipse IDE Installation
The Eclipse IDE relies on a larger ecosystem of tools and these instructions assume you are familar enough with the Eclispe IDE environment to make any required configuration changes to the IDE setup.

### Step 1:
Download and install the **Eclipse IoT Embedded CDT IDE** (this will eventually be replaced by a pre-configured CORE-V IDE based on the Eclipse IDE tools).  
~~~
https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.embed-cdt/downloads
~~~

### Step 2:
Download and install the approriate corev-gcc toolchain from
~~~
https://www.embecosm.com/resources/tool-chain-downloads/#corev
~~~

### Step 3:
Install OpenOCD.  Recommend getting it from this location:
~~~
https://sourceforge.net/projects/openocd/files/openocd/
~~~
Version 0.11.0-rc2 is known to work with this setup.

Installation is accomplished by:
~~~
./configure --enable-ftdi && make
sudo make install
~~~

### Step 4: run the Eclipse IDE and import projects directly from this OpenHW git repo

NOTE: importing the cli_test project into the IDE does not import the information to launch the debugger, so after importing cli_test, be sure to either import the launch configuration (below in Step 5) or create your own.

#### Step 4.1: Launch Eclipse
~~~
eclipse
~~~
![step1](./images/1-IDE-Launcher.png)

#### Step 4.2: From Welcome, select Import
![step2](./images/2-Welcome.png)

#### Step 4.3: Select Import Projects from Git

![step3](./images/3-Import.png)

#### Step 4.4: Specify Clone URL

![step4](./images/4-ImportFromGit.png)

#### Step 4.5: Specify the Source Git Repository
Provide the full URL path to `core-v-mcu-cli-test`.
The path you provide will depend on the protocol used to access GitHub.
For example, [https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu-cli-test.git](https://github.com/openhwgroup/core-v-mcu-cli-test.git) is the path when using https.

![step5](./images/5-RepoName.png)

#### Step 4.6: Select the branch to clone
Note: the list of branches will change over time.
The `main` branch is stable, but not necessarily the latest.
All other branches are development branches and may not be stable.

![step6](./images/6-BranchName.png)

#### Step 4.7: Specify directory for git to use (use the default)

![step7](./images/7-LocalDestination.png)

#### Step 4.8: Select which Wizard to use for import

![step8](./images/8-SelectWizard.png)

#### Step 4.9: Select projects to import
`cli_test` is the only one you need.

![step9](./images/9-ImportProjects.png)

#### Step 4.10: Select 'Finish'
You should see something like this after selecting 'Finish'.

![step10](./images/10-ProjectsAreSetup.png)

### Step 5: Configure the Toolchain
This step configures Eclipse so that it finds the CORE-V toolchain and OpenOCD that were downloaded and installed in **Step 2** and **Step 3**.

#### Step 5.1: Select Properties
In the Eclipse Project Explorer select the `cli_test` Project, right click and select `Properties` (typically appears at the bottom of the pop-up menu).
Select `C/C++ Build / Settings` to bring up the window below:

![Step 5.1](./images/5p1-Properties_for_cli_test.png)

#### Step 5.2: Configure Toolchain
In this example, the `Toolchain path` was changed by selecting the `workspace` preference page.
This brings up the Preferences selection window.
On the left-hand pane select  "MCU/Workspace RISC-V Toolchains Paths" and update the Toolchain folder to point to your toolchain install path.

![Step 5.2](./images/5p2-WorkspaceRISC-VToolchainsPaths.png)

#### Step 5.3: Configure OpenOCD
This is similar to setting the Toolchain tool.
In the Preferneces selectionn window select "MCU/Workspace OpenOCD Path" and update to point to your openocd install path.

![Step 5.3](./images/5p3-WorkspaceOpenOCDPaths.png)

### Step 6: Compile cli_test
Assuming everything above has completed this step is simplicity itself.
With `cli_test` selected in the Project Explorer pane, click on Build (the hammer icon):

![Step6.0](./images/BuildCliTest.png)

### Step 7: Import launch configuration

This step pulls in the launch configurations which are configured to use **OpenOCD** with the [JTAG-HS2](https://digilent.com/shop/jtag-hs2-programming-cable/) programmer or the [Ashling Opella-LD](https://www.ashling.com/support-opella-ld/).

Reminder: the instructions for connecting the HS2 to the Nexys A7 and the Ashling Opella-LD to the Nexys A7 can be found in the CORE-V-MCU Quick Start Guide (a link can be found at the top of this README) and the Ashling Opella-LD User Manual can be found [here](https://www.ashling.com/wp-content/uploads/Opella-LD_User_Manual.pdf).

If your hardware setup is different, you can either ignore this step and create your own, or use this step and modify to fit your configuration.

#### Step 7.1:
Select 'File' and then 'Import...'.

![step11](./images/11-ImportLaunch.png)

#### Step 7.2:
Select 'Run/Debug' and then 'Launch Configurations'.

![step12](./images/12-SelectLaunchConfig.png)

#### Step 7.3:
Here you will fetch the HS2 or the Ashling Opella-LD launch configuration from your clone of core-v-mcu-cli-test repository.
In the `core-v-mcu-cli-test` repo there is a set of launch configurations in the `launch` directory.
Use the `Browse...` button to navigate to the git directory that was chosen as the 'Local Destination' in **Step 4.7** and then `launch`.

Select 'launch' and choose 'cli_test hs2.lauch' or 'cli_test Ashling Opella-LD.launch'.

![step14](./images/14-SelectLaunchConfigurations.png)

#### Step 7.5:
Under the `Run` menu select `Debug Configurations...`

![step15](./images/15-DebugConfig.png)

#### Step 7.6: Run/Restart settings
Edit the debug configurations and in the Startup tab scroll down to the Run/Restart Commands section to make sure the `Pre-run/Restart Reset` box is _not_ checked.

![step16](./images/RunRestart.png)

#### Step 7.7:
Under `GDB OpenOCD Debugging` 

  i) select `cli_test Default` and then `Debug`to run HS2 to the Nexys A7.
  
  ii) select `cli_test Ashling Opella-LD` and then `Debug`to run Opella-LD to the Nexys A7.

![step17](./images/16-cli_testDefault.png)

This should compile, link and load the application and stop at main waiting for you to start debugging.


## Peripheral support
The type and number of peripherals supported are defined by `pulp_soc_defines.sv`.
The information is made available to software applications as a series of #define values in the 'SOC options' section of 'target/core-v-mcu/include/core-v-mcu-config.h'.
An example configuration is:
~~~
// SOC options
#define N_IO                 48         // Total available IO
#define N_SYSIO              3
#define N_GPIO               32
#define N_UART               2          // Number of uarts
#define N_QSPIM              1          // Number of QuadSPI masters
#define N_I2CM               2          // Number of I2C masters
#define N_I2SC               0
#define N_CSI2               0
#define N_HYPER              0
#define N_SDIO               0
#define N_CAM                1
#define N_JTAG               0
#define N_MRAM               0
#define N_FILTER             1
#define N_FPGA               1
#define N_EXT_PER            0
#define N_EFPGA_TCDM_PORTS   4
#define N_FPGAIO             43
#define N_EFPGA_EVENTS       16
